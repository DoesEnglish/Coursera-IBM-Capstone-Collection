# Coursera-IBM-Capstone-Collection
This is a collection of the final capstone project. We were taking launch data from the Space X API and performing our machinations on it. 
During this project I found a few things especially interesting. One in particular is the ability to create the Folium interactive maps. I've wanted to create exactly this sort of map for Electric Vehicle charging stations across the United States for a long time. 
Everything in this is straight forward and includes all instructions. Hopefully this is more interesting to click through than the 45 slide Power Point they have us create at the end. 

I think for people less versed in statistics it's going to be easy to draw strange conclusions. For instance, successful landings of first stages occur more frequently at certain launch sites. This is confusing to some visually. Ideally we would include a timeline alongside any launch statistics since it would show that the launch site doesn't affect success so much as the advances in technology over the years.
